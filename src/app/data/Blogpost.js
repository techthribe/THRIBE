        <div>I started Tech Thribe (THR!BE) because I&#39;ve seen how easy it is to lose yourself in the speed and pressure of tech - the 
        endless deadlines, the constant need to “keep up,” and the quiet burnout that follows.
        <p>This piece is personal. It&#39;s about 
        what I&#39;ve learned as a UX designer (noe Human Experience Designer) - and as a human trying to find balance in a world that 
        rarely pauses.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
       <p class="mt-[24px]"> When I first got into design, all I wanted was to make things work.Perfect flows, clean UIs, intuitive navigation - that was the goal. 
       I obsessed over usability, alignment grids, and how every pixel could behave perfectly on every screen.
       </p>
       <p>
        But somewhere along the way, I realized something important - the best designs aren&#39;t just functional; they&#39;re deeply human.
        Putting humans at the center of design doesn&#39;t just make products better. It makes us better too.
        </p>
        <p>
        When you start to empathize - really empathize - with the people you design for, you begin to see life differently. 
        You start thinking about accessibility beyond color contrast, communication beyond copy, and inclusion beyond personas. 
        You start designing with heart, not just strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
        As a designer, that shift changed everything for me. It made me more patient, more observant, 
        and more aware of how people live, work, and feel. And honestly? It made me a better human.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <p class="mt-[24px]">
        That&#39;s what THR!BE is about - finding balance between the work we do and the people we are becoming through it. It&#39;s a reminder that behind every “user” is a real person - and behind every designer is one too.
        So as we build, let&#39;s remember to pause, breathe, and check in with ourselves. Let&#39;s keep asking the question that started all of this for me:
        </p>
        <p>
        “How do we stay human in our work, our relationships, and our ambitions?”
        </p>
        <p>
        Because thriving isn&#39;t about doing more. It&#39;s about doing what matters, with our hearts. 💚

          <p>
          I wasn&apos;t taught how to give feedback - and I don&apos;t know anyone who was. We just learned to say “Kudos!” or “You could improve this part,” without realizing how much our tone, timing, or emotions carry through.
          </p>
          <p>
          The truth? Feedback isn&apos;t just information. It&apos;s communication - filtered through emotion, intent, and ego.
          </p>
          </div>
          <div className='mt-[24px]'>
          <h2 className="font-[600]">The Two Sides of Feedback</h2>
          <p>
          Every feedback exchange has two humans in it - the giver and the receiver. Both bring their own state of mind, experience, and self-awareness to the table. 
          </p>
          <p>
          When the giver&apos;s undertone comes from frustration, the receiver often hears: “You&apos;re not good enough.”
          </p>
          <p>
          And when that feedback is met with defense, the giver hears:
          </p>
          <p>
          “You don&apos;t value my input.”
          </p>
          <p>
          That&apos;s how small misunderstandings grow into big emotional gaps.
          </p>
          </p>
          </div>

          <div className="mt-[24px]>
          <h2 className="font-[600]>The Four Types of Feedback</h2>
          <p>Here&apos;s how feedback shows up - in design, work, and life:</p>
          <p>
          <span className="font-[500]">1. Constructive Feedback:</span> Meant to improve the work - specific, clear, and actionable. For example; “The flow works, but the signup feels a bit long. Maybe we can simplify the steps.” The tone is usually helpful, balanced and solution-focused.
          </p>
          <p>
           <span className="font-[500]"> 2. Appreciative Feedback:</span> Reinforces positive behavior and effort. For example; “I love how you simplified the interface - it’s so intuitive.” The tone is usually warm, affirming and encouraging.
          </p>
          <p>
          <span className="font-[500]">3. Evaluative Feedback:,/span> Measures performance against a standard. For example; “This doesn’t meet the brand guideline.”The tone is usually neutral but can feel judgmental depending on delivery.
          </p>
          <p>
          <span className="font-[500]">4. Destructive Feedback:</span> Focuses on fault, not improvement. For example; “This makes no sense; did you even test it?”. The tone usually is ego-driven, disrespectful, emotionally charged.
          </p>
          </div>

          <div className="mt-[24px]>
          <h2 className="font-[600]>The Characteristics of Good Feedback</h2>
          <div>
          <p>Good feedback has five things in common:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It&apos;s clear, not vague.</li>
            <li>Focused on the work, not the person.</li>
            <li>Timely, not delayed.</li>
            <li>Empathetic, not performative.</li>
            <li>Specific, not general.</li>
          </ul>
          </div>
          </div>

          <div className="mt-[24px]>
          <h2 className="font-[600]>When Feedback Hurts</h2>
          <div>
          <p>Sometimes feedback isn&apos;t really feedback - it&apos;s disguised frustration. 
          And sometimes defense isn&apos;t pride - it&apos;s insecurity trying to protect itself. 
          Even silence is feedback and often the loudest kind.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-[24px]>
          “This is… interesting.” could mean “I don&apos;t like it but I don&apos;t want to argue.” 
          Or “I&apos;ll think about it.” could be “I&apos;ve already decided no.”
          </p>
          </div>
          </div>

          <div className="mt-[24px]>
          <h2 className="font-[600]>How to Give Feedback That Lands</h2>
          <div>   
          <ul>
            <li>
            Regulate yourself first - don&apos;t give feedback angry or tired.
            </li>
            <li>
            Focus on the “why” before the “what.”
            </li>
            <li>
            Replace criticism with curiosity.
            </li>
            <li>
            “What made you choose this layout?” instead of “This doesn&apos;t make sense.”
            </li>
            <li>
            End with openness - invite dialogue, don&apos;t close it.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </div>
          </div>

          <div className="mt-[24px]>
          <h2 className="font-[600]>How to Receive Feedback Without Losing Yourself</h2>
          <div>   
          <ul>
            <li>
            Listen for intent, not tone. Sometimes people mean well but express it poorly.
            </li>
            <li>
            Separate your work from your worth.
            </li>
            <li>
           Ask clarifying questions instead of defending.
            </li>
            <li>
            Reflect before reacting.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </div>
          </div>

          <div className="mt-[24px]>
          <h2 className="font-[600]>Feedback as Connection</h2>
          <div>
          <p>
          When done right, feedback isn&apos;t about proving who&apos;s smarter - it&apos;s about helping each other grow and as creatives, 
          teammates, and humans, we owe it to each other to make feedback a bridge, not a wall
          </p>

          <p className="mt-[24px]>
          Because behind every critique is a person trying to be understood.And in giving and receiving feedback, 
          our goal should to empathetically communicate while staying human. 💚
